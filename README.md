# Bacterial Comparative Genomics Analytic Workflow

## Comparative Genomic Analysis of Phocaeicola dorei-like Strains Isolated from Either Pre-industrial or Industrial Populations
2022 BINF6999 Bioinformatics Masterâ€™s Project, University of Guelph

Advisors:

Dr. Emma Allen-Vercoe (The Allen-Vercoe lab)

Dr. Andrew M. Kropinski

#### Raw data: Illumina MiSeq paired-end FASTQ short reads files of whole genome sequence of novel Phocaeicola dorei isolate retrived from the fecal sample of a Yanomami villager


This analytic workflow consists of three major parts:
1) Draft genome assembly of novel isolate
2) Genome annotation (structure, function, specialty gene)
3) Genomic and proteomic comparison between genomes of novel isolate and reference
